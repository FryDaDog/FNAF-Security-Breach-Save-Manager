# FNAF Security Breach Save Manager
A manager to inject saves to FNAF SB

# How to use it?
Put the saves into the "Files" Folder

Then, execute "Shortcut Creator". This will create a shortcut to the "manager.bat" file. You can move this shortcut.

Run the shortcut. The manager will now run!

# My FNAF SB save files are not in the default folder!

Don't worry, if the folder is not detected, it will prompt you to enter a location.
